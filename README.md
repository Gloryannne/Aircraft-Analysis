<h1>Aircraft Risk Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on analyzing risks associated with aircraft operations using data-driven techniques. It aims to identify key risk factors, visualize patterns, and provide actionable insights for improving safety.

This repository contains a python script for analyzing trends in aircraft incidents, accidents, and associated risks. The analysis helps aviation stakeholders decide which low-risk aircraft to purchase and operate on, as well start the business enedeavour.

<h2>Features</h2>
Analysis of historical aircraft incident data.

Identification of key risk factors influencing aircraft safety.

Visualizations of trends in accident overtime, weather conditions, flight purpose, and locations.


<h2>Dataset</h2>
This project uses publicly available aviation safety datasets (e.g. National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.). Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are included in the analysis pipeline.
